# SCHull

**SCHull** (Sparse, Connected, and Rigid Graph Construction) is a geometry-aware method for building molecular and point-cloud graphs that are sparse, connected, and rigid â€” ideal for use in 3D geometric learning tasks such as molecular modeling and protein structure representation.

This repository supports the ICLR 2025 Oral Presentation:  
**[A Theoretically-Principled Sparse, Connected, and Rigid Graph Representation of Molecules](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OIvg3MqWX2)**

ðŸ’» Code will be available soon as a pip-installable library!

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ”§ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shihhsinwang0214/SCHull.git
```

### ðŸ§± Import SCHull

```python
from SCHull import SCHull
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ Usage: `get_schull`

### Inputs

```python
SCHull.get_schull(positions: np.ndarray, atom_types: np.ndarray)
```

- `positions`: NumPy array of shape `(N, 3)` for 3D coordinates.
- `atom_types`: NumPy array of shape `(N,)` with atom type labels (or placeholders).

### Outputs

Returns:
- `positions`: the original input.
- `atom_types`: the original input.
- `edge_index`: source-target index pairs.
- `edge_attr`: edge features (length, angle).
- `radial_arr`: radial distances.

## ðŸ§ª Example

```python
import numpy as np
from torch_geometric.data import Data
from SCHull import SCHull

pos = np.random.rand(10, 3) * 10
atoms = np.zeros(10, dtype=int)

schull = SCHull()
_, _ , edge_index, edge_attr, radial_arr = schull.get_schull(pos, atoms)

data = Data(atoms=atoms, edge_index=to_undirected(edge_index), pos=pos, natoms= 10, cell=cell, edge_attr= edge_attr)
```

## ðŸ“Œ About

This project is developed as part of ongoing research in symmetry-aware geometric deep learning. It was proposed and led by Shih-Hsin Wang and received an **Oral Presentation** at ICLR 2025 (top 1.8%).

---

## âœ¨ Coming Soon

- `pip install schull` support
- Integration with popular molecular datasets
- Prebuilt graph visualizations
